This is the full code of my mini project using beautifulsoup to scrapy the job information in JobsDB. 
For explaination please refer to the above medium article.

Objective: Scrape local jobs search website JobsDB
Brainstorm and difficulties: I want to get the following information: job title, company, required skills, year of experience..etc then see what are the most important skills as a data analyst in Hong Kong. To begin with, I read several articles but their job search websites are largely different from JobsDB. First, JobsDB wont show you the detail information until you manually click on the job post. The best way to tickle this maybe using Selenium/ scrapy but I donâ€™t familiarize with them. Second, the information are hidden in the script tag/xpath, which make data extraction more difficult.

For easier reading purpose I remove all my personal comments from the jupyter notebbok. 
If you have difficulties in reading the code, feel free to leave a comment.
Thanks
